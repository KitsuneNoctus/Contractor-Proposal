# Contractor Proposal
### Idea: "Time Card"
- What you’re going to create.
    - l want to create a time keeping application for college classes that require a certain amount of hours to be logged, as well as a number of labs. The applicatio would allow the instructors to see the students and what activity they've tracked, but would not be able to alter the students hours. (Under certain circumstances they could but it would require special permissions). It would generate a random code each day at the start of class that the student would have to enter to start the time clock.  I want it to be simlar to how the Make School does thier login
- Why it’s useful.
    -  It allows for students and teachers to keep accurate track of their hours and what they need to compete each semester, as well as allowing for accountability on both teachers and students. There would also be the prevention of tampering with student hours as well.
